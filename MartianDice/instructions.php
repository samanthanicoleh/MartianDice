        <p class="square-p">
          In 'Martian Dice' you start by rolling 13 dice, while 'setting aside' Humans,
          Chickens and Cows.
          You MUST set aside any Tanks, representing the military
          trying to stop your invasion. You can then choose to set aside Death Rays,
          or any of the earthlings (Humans, Chickens, Cows). At the end of your turn you MUST have as many Death Rays
          as Tanks (or more), otherwise you get 0 points. You can not pick any type of Earthling
          twice in one turn.

          Player One goes first - this is based on random choice. After rolling all 13 dice
          the Player One automatically keeps all of the rolled tanks. Then,
          he can choose to keep either Death Rays, Humans, Cows or Chickens
          (only one earthling counts towards the points). Player One can then
          choose to roll again or count up the points and end his/her turn.

        <p class="square-p">
          If Player One decides to end his/her turn - the points are counted
          and added to the scoreboard.
          <br>However, if Player One decides to reroll, the player can choose which
          dice he/she would like to keep and which to reroll (Tanks are automatically
          kept).

        <p class="square-p">
          After the reroll Player One can continue to reroll again (this is a risk
          because of the possibility of rolling Tanks which would require the need of Death Rays), or count up the points and end his/her turn.
          <br> The game ends when each player has finished collecting each of the
          earthlings, and the player with the highest points wins.
